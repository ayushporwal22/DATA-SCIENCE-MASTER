    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" which can contain data and functions that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Class in OOP is a blueprint or a template for creating objects that define a set of attributes and behaviors that an object will have. A class can be thought of as a blueprint or a plan for creating objects that have a specific set of properties and behaviors.\n",

    "An Object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence of the class, which contains its own set of data and methods. Objects can interact with one another through their methods, and they can be created, modified, and destroyed during the execution of a program.\n",
